Machine Learning Assignments
This repository contains 6 Machine Learning tasks combined into a single notebook:
ML_All_Tasks.ipynb

 How It Works
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Run all the cells.

A menu will appear where you can choose which task to run (1–6).

Each number corresponds to one ML task.

Tasks Included
