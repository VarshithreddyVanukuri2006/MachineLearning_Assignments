 Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains **6 Machine Learning tasks** combined into a single notebook:  
**`ML_All_Tasks.ipynb`**

  How It Works
- Open the notebook in **VS Code (Jupyter extension)** or **Google Colab**.  
- Run all the cells.  
- A **menu** will appear where you can choose which task to run (1–6).  
- Each number corresponds to one ML task.
 Tasks Included
1. **Movie Recommendation (Content-Based Filtering)** – suggests movies based on genres using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.  
2. **Movie Recommendation (Collaborative Filtering)** – suggests movies using user ratings and correlation.  
3. **Spam Email Classifier** – detects spam using Naive Bayes and Bag-of-Words.  
4. **Sentiment Analysis (IMDB Example)** – classifies reviews as positive or negative.  
5. **Stock Price Prediction** – predicts future stock prices using Linear Regression.  
6. **Digit Recognition (MNIST Dataset)** – uses a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
